Count Brackets
1. You are given a number n, representing the number of opening brackets ( and closing brackets )
2. You are required to find the number of ways in which you can arrange the brackets if the closing brackets should never exceed opening brackets
e.g.
for 1, answer is 1 -> ()
for 2, answer is 2 -> ()(), (())
for 3, asnwer is 5 -> ()()(), () (()), (())(), (()()), ((()))
